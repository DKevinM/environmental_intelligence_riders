# via the Cloudflare Tunnel (status.krmenvironmental.com), which involves
# no git/Pages build at all; this git copy is just a slower-but-durable
# backup, so there's no reason to push it at the same cadence, and pushing
# it that often is exactly what caused the earlier Pages build failures.
# Uses the same git lock as run_and_publish.sh (not the watch-only lock
# above) so the two scripts never run git commands against this repo
