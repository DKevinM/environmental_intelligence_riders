# Copy the real-time status (written every minute, outside the repo — see
# watch.py) into the git-tracked docs/watch_status.json as a durable
# GitHub-Pages-served fallback — but only every PUBLISH_INTERVAL_SECONDS at
# most, and the throttle is checked BEFORE touching the working tree at
# all, so between publishes the repo stays completely clean. Previously
# watch.py wrote directly into docs/, which left an uncommitted change
# sitting in the working tree most of the time (this step only committed
# every 5 min) and blocked run_and_publish.sh's own `git pull --rebase`
# whenever its cycle landed mid-window — that's what stalled
# edmonton_folk_fest's sit-rep for over an hour on 2026-08-06, and this
# repo has the identical bug. Uses the same git lock as run_and_publish.sh
# (not the watch-only lock above) so the two scripts never run git
# commands against this repo concurrently.
